                            encounter in the everyday world, that’s often missing in the world of computers.
                            Unfortunately we’re used to this fuzziness, and so its lack can make computers hard to use.
                            <br> I remember watching episodes of Star Trek where the Enterprise was in danger.
                            Fortunately, the shields had kept the crew safe, but they were gradually failing. A crew
                            member would call out to the rest of the bridge: “Shields at 78%!” and then later “Shields
                            at 54%!” and so on. <span><a href="#" class="read-more">Read More...</a></span>

                                Museum, where a conservator discusses a 500-year-old khipu. A khipu is a document, used
                                for keeping records or accounts, made of knotted strings. <br> I recommend you watch the
                                video – I found it really interesting and well-presented. I hadn’t come across khipus
                                before, and they raised all sorts of interesting ideas and questions. <span><a href="#"

                                that they ask all their guests is: What do you think is the coolest thing in technology?
                                This article is my answer to that. The short version is: standards, and the benefits
                                they bring to users. The longer version is below. <br> Standards might seem the opposite
                                of cool, particularly in the world of technology where the parade of mayfly-like Latest
                                Shiny Things seems to never come to a rest. It feels like saying the coolest thing about
